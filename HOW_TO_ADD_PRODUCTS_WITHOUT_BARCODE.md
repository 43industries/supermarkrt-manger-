## 💡 Examples

### ✅ Good - Product WITHOUT Barcode:
```

## 🆘 Can't Find the "Add Product" Button?

If you don't see the "Add Product" button:

1. Make sure you're logged in as **Admin** (cashier can't add products)
2. Check that you're in the **Products** section (not Dashboard, POS, etc.)
3. Look for a green or blue button that says:
   - "Add Product"
   - "New Product"
   - "+ Add Product"
   - Or a "+" icon button
